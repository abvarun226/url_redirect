URL Shortener and Bookmark Tool
===============================

Just a simple weekend project. Used Flask, oauth2 (google), Bootstrap and SQLite3 to build the app. Basically you can give a custom name to a long or important URL and save it in the app, and use the name to redirect to that URL.

Utilities
=========
To run scripts under utilities directory, use this command structure,

`python -m utilities.get_data`
